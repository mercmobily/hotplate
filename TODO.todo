☐ Add basic app, so that it works
☐ Add modules
   - client-app-frame (ask for [x] appPrefix, [x] tpe, [ ] responsiveness, [ ] routify [ ] dynamic loading, [ ] drawer ?)
   - client-back-bar (historify and header, and SOME of pageMixin)

   - server-store

   - client-reducs

   - client-server-auth
   - client-server-user-config
   - client-server-app-config

  Reinstallable pages
   - client-store-list
   - client-store-view
   - client-store-edit
   - client-root-page
   - client-page
   - client-tabbed-page

  Less important
   - client-server-shared-code

☐ Generally tidy up, improve code, start documenting it as literate code
☐ Figure out how to change eslint rules in open-wc
☐ Organise literate documentation to module code
☐ Add initial docco-next documentation generation to js-kit
☐ Make list of all missing modules to be added
  ☐ user-login (with DB init queries)
  ☐ client-stores
  ☐ ...?

Testing:
rm -rf testing-app;cp -pr testing-app.START testing-app; node Development/scaffoldizer/bin/scaffoldizer add Development/js-kit testing-app


rm -rf testing-app;cp -pr testing-app.START testing-app; rm -rf testing-app/node_modules; rm -rf testing-app/server/node_modules;node Development/scaffoldizer/bin/scaffoldizer add Development/js-kit testing-app everything; cd testing-app; npm install;cd ..


NOT DONE
☐ Change "// *** -- start" into self-contained blocks /* */ -- NOT SURE WHY I SHOULD
☐ Change json to json5, in order to being able to add comments -- CHANGE OF HEART
